Hello, dear user! We are glad to greeting you in our program!

Before you start using it, we would like to clarify a few points that you will encounter when 
using it to make it easier for you to use it.

1. In order to reduce the number of actions performed by the user, we have reduced the data that you 
will enter while using the program to perform certain actions. For example, in order to go to the menu 
that you need, you will have to enter its number written next to it. The same method we used for the 
name of the action that you want the computer to perform: in this case,you will have to enter the first
letter of the name of this action.

2. In addition, we would like to advise you not to rush and enter valid data so as not to slow down the 
process of obtaining the information you need and save your time.

Thanks, for your attention! We hope that this information was useful for you and will make it easier 
for you to use the program.
